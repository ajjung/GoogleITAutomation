A script will then email the client with a PDF file stating what was uploaded to the website.
changeImage.py takes a directory of images and formats them to fit the requirements of the client's website.
supplier_image_upload.py uploads the images to the suppliers website
run.py takes the images on the suppliers website and posts them together with the product's descriptions 
report_email.py sends an email to the supplier with an attached PDF stating what was successfully uploaded to the website.
